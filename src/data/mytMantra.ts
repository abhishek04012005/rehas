        question: 'Do I need to believe to benefit from mantras?',

          'Mantras work through vibration and sound resonance, which are physical phenomena. While faith enhances benefits, the science of sound works regardless of belief.',

        question: 'How many times should I chant a mantra daily?',

          'Traditional practice involves 108 repetitions (one mala). Beginners can start with 27 repetitions (1/4 mala) and gradually increase.',

        question: 'Can I practice mantras in any language?',

        question: 'How long before I see results?',

          'Morning (Brahma muhurta) and evening are ideal times. However, consistent daily practice is more important than timing.',
