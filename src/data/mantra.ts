      'Mantras are sacred words, phrases, or sounds that have been used for thousands of years to focus the mind, elevate consciousness, and create positive transformation. Derived from Sanskrit, mantras work through the power of sound vibration, accessing the deepest layers of consciousness.

      {
        question: 'Do I need to be religious to practice mantras?',
        answer:
          'No. Mantras are universal spiritual tools that work beyond religious boundaries. They focus on sound vibration and intention rather than belief.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How long should I practice a mantra?',
        answer:
          'Start with 10-15 minutes daily. Traditional practice suggests 108 repetitions (one mala). Consistency matters more than duration.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What language should mantras be in?',
        answer:
          'Sanskrit mantras are traditional and carry specific vibrational frequencies, but the intention and focus you bring matter most.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I practice multiple mantras?',
        answer:
          'Yes, but it\'s recommended to establish one primary mantra first. You can learn others as your practice deepens.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Will mantras work if I don\'t believe in them?',
        answer:
          'Mantras work through sound frequency and vibrational resonance. Openness helps, but even skeptics often experience benefits.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How do I know which mantra is right for me?',
        answer:
          'Our practitioners help select mantras aligned with your intentions. You may also resonate intuitively with certain mantras.',
