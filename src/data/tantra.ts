    title: 'What is Tantra?',
    description:
      'Tantra is an ancient esoteric spiritual tradition that celebrates all aspects of existence as sacred. Rather than rejecting the physical world, Tantra teaches that everything—including energy, sensation, and pleasure—can be a path to enlightenment. Tantric practices activate dormant energy (kundalini), align chakras, and harmonize the divine masculine and feminine energies within every individual, leading to profound spiritual awakening and personal transformation.',
